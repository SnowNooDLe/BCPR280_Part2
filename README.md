## Running program with UI, browser
1. Please run 'nodeServer.js' file that is under src directory.
    * e.g. node nodeServer.js in terminal / command.
2. Then jump into index.html
3. Choose two files between testdata1 ~ testdata3 txt files.
4. Submit files (Do not worry, if you are trying to submit without choosing two files, will see warning pop up)
5. Once its submitted, click Show button, it will show you the results (Once again, if you forgot to submit files, will show warning first)
6. For Node part, nodeServer.js must be running.
7. Enjoy.

## To run command line application for nodejs
1. type this in command line 
    * node Calculator_Command.js testData1.txt TestData2.txt result.txt  
2. Will automatically generate txt file called 'result.txt' with Correlation & Regression value
3. Simply 
    * node - to run node file
    * Calculator_Command.js - name of the file that we want to run
    * testData1.txt - first file to read
    * TestData2.txt - second file to read
    * result.txt - place where result will be stored


## Aim: Write a program that calculates the correlation of two arrays of numbers
Things to do
1. Adapt / extend the first program to calculate the regression of two arrays of numbers.
2. Provide a user interface with Vuejs
3. Provide a user interface with Reactjs
4. Provide a user interface with Nodejs
5. Enhance the user interface with Bootstrap css
6. Create a command line application for Nodejs that reads and write to file
7. Create a RESTful web service for Nodejs that return JSON data
